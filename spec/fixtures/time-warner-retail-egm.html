  <p class="subhead">EGM Re-Launch to Be Handled By Nation&rsquo;s Leading Newsstand Magazine Distributor</p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><strong>December 18, 2009 - Beverly Hills, CA </strong><span class="bodycopy">&ndash; EGM Media LLC, publisher of leading independent video game magazine &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly,&quot; announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Time/Warner Retail Sales &amp; Marketing to handle newsstand marketing and sales for the title when it returns to bookstores, newsstands, and other retailers in March 2010.</span></p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"> &ldquo;Time Warner Retail is the preeminent player in the single-copy field so it should be no surprise that we have selected them to represent the print version of the publication,&rdquo; said Steve Harris, publisher of Electronic Gaming Monthly and president of EGM Media, LLC.  &ldquo;The fact Time/Warner Retail&rsquo;s relationship with the title goes back nearly twenty years made this an easy decision and one that will immediately benefit our efforts.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to once again be representing one of the leading titles in its category,&rdquo; said Mike Bogas, Senior Marketing Manager of Time/Warner Retail Sales &amp; Marketing.  &ldquo;Electronic Gaming Monthly is a brand that is synonymous with the gaming field and one that has consistently performed well for us in the past.  The new changes that EGM is making to integrate print and digital will only enhance the product further.&rdquo; </span></p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"> The new print version of Electronic Gaming Monthly includes a special code included in each newsstand copy that upgrades each reader&rsquo;s access to the new weekly interactive version of the magazine.  This enhanced version of the digital publication, called EGM[i]: The Digital Magazine contains exclusive article extensions and original content throughout each issue.</span></p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"> &quot;With our new weekly digital format, and the premium enhancement that newsstand purchasers will receive, we're changing the value proposition in a new and meaningful way,&quot; explained Harris. &quot;Not only does the digital companion allow us to offer additional content that is complementary to the print magazine, but it also gives us a way to communicate with our readers and update the print product in an ongoing manner.&quot; </span></p>
  <p align="left" class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy"> This first issue of the new print edition of Electronic Gaming Monthly will carry an April cover and include a special cover story continuing the EGM tradition of highlighting the best games of the year.  The premier issue of the re-launch will also boast game previews, a new Review Crew featuring the return of Sushi-X, and commentary from a host of columnists including EGM personalities such as Quartermann, Dan &ldquo;Shoe&rdquo; Hsu, Sean &ldquo;Seanbaby&rdquo; Reiley, and many others.</span></p>
